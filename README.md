Wundernap adds support for start/defer dates to Wunderlist, valuable for recurring tasks as well as anything you can't work on Right Now. It automatically moves tasks into a "Snoozed" list to get them out of your way, and moves them back when you're ready to work on them. To snooze a task, give it a reminder and then either:

- Set it to recur, with any time interval. Each recurrence will be snoozed until its reminder arrives.
- Add the tag #snooze to the task title, and it will be snoozed until the reminder arrives.

When Wundernap snoozes a task, it will be moved into the list Snoozed if it's not there already. Additionally the due date, assignee, and star will all be deleted from it - this keeps it from appearing on smartlists like 'today' and 'assigned to me' while it's snoozing.

To awaken a snoozed task:
- Wait for the reminder to trigger,
- or just open your Snoozed list and delete the reminder if you can't wait!

An awakened task will have its original due date, assignee, and star all restored, and it will be moved back to its original list.
